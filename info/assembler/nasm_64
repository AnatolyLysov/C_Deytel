The command you've provided is used to assemble a NASM (Netwide Assembler) source file (`main.s`) into an object file (`main.o`) for the 64-bit ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) target. The `-g` option indicates that debugging information should be included in the object file, which is useful for debugging with tools like `gdb`.

### Breakdown of the Command

- **`nasm`**: This is the command to invoke the NASM assembler.
  
- **`-f elf64`**: This option specifies the output format of the object file. In this case, `elf64` indicates that the output will be in the 64-bit ELF format, which is standard for 64-bit Linux applications.

- **`-g`**: This flag tells NASM to include debugging information in the output file. This information allows debuggers to provide useful insights into the program, such as variable names and line numbers.

- **`main.s`**: This is the input source file written in NASM assembly language. The `.s` extension typically indicates an assembly source file.

- **`-o main.o`**: This option specifies the output filename. Here, `main.o` will be the object file created by NASM.

### Example Usage

Here's how you might use this command in a typical workflow:

1. **Create Your Assembly Source File** (e.g., `main.s`):

```nasm
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, World!', 0  ; Null-terminated string

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Write the message to stdout
    mov rax, 1          ; syscall number for sys_write
    mov rdi, 1          ; file descriptor 1 is stdout
    mov rsi, msg        ; pointer to the message
    mov rdx, 13         ; message length
    syscall             ; call kernel

    ; Exit the program
    mov rax, 60         ; syscall number for sys_exit
    xor rdi, rdi        ; exit code 0
    syscall             ; call kernel
```

2. **Assemble the Code**:

Run the command you provided:

```bash
nasm -f elf64 -g main.s -o main.o
```

3. **Link the Object File**:

Use a linker (like `ld`) to create an executable. You can also include debugging information here:

```bash
ld -o main main.o
```

4. **Run the Debugger**:

Start `gdb` with your executable:

```bash
gdb ./main
```

### Debugging with GDB

Once you are in `gdb`, you can use commands like:

- `break _start`: Set a breakpoint at the start of the program.
- `run`: Start running the program.
- `step`: Step through the code line by line.
- `print <variable>`: Inspect the value of a variable or register.
- `continue`: Continue execution until the next breakpoint.
- `quit`: Exit `gdb`.

### Summary

Using the command `nasm -f elf64 -g main.s -o main.o` allows you to assemble a NASM source file for 64-bit Linux with debugging information, making it easier to debug your assembly programs. If you have further questions or need additional examples, feel free to ask!
