To create a `CMakeLists.txt` file that compiles a C file named `page487.c`, you can use the following example code. 
This assumes that you want 
to create a simple executable from the C source file.

Hereâ€™s a sample `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# Specify the minimum version of CMake required
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# Set the project name
project(Page487Project C)

# Add the executable target
add_executable(page487 page487.c)
```

### Instructions:

1. Create a file named `CMakeLists.txt` in the same directory as `page487.c`.
2. Copy and paste the above code into `CMakeLists.txt`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing these files.
4. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
5. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```
6. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

This will compile `page487.c` and create an executable named `page487` in the `build` directory. 
Adjust the project name and executable name as needed.
