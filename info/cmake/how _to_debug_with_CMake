Debugging with CMake involves a few steps to ensure that your build configuration is set up correctly for debugging.
Here’s a general guide to help you debug your CMake-based project:

### Step 1: Set Up Your CMakeLists.txt

Ensure that your `CMakeLists.txt` file is configured to include debugging information. 
You can do this by setting the build type to `Debug`. Here’s how you can do it:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

# Set the build type to Debug
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)

# Add your executable or library
add_executable(my_executable main.cpp)
```

### Step 2: Generate the Build System

Run CMake to generate the build system. You can do this from the command line:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

### Step 3: Build the Project

After generating the build system, compile your project in the build directory:

```bash
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

### Step 4: Use a Debugger

You can use a debugger like GDB (GNU Debugger) or LLDB (LLVM Debugger) to debug your application. Here’s how to do it with GDB:

1. **Run GDB**:
   ```bash
   gdb ./my_executable
   ```

2. **Set Breakpoints**:
   Inside GDB, you can set breakpoints at specific lines or functions:
   ```gdb
   (gdb) break main
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   Start your program within GDB:
   ```gdb
   (gdb)   
   ```

4. **Inspect Variables**:
   You can inspect variables and step through the code:
   ```gdb
   (gdb) print variable_name
   (gdb) step
   (gdb) next
   ```

5. **Exit GDB**:
   To exit GDB, you can type:
   ```gdb
   (gdb) quit
   ```

### Step 5: Debugging in an IDE

If you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, CLion, or Eclipse, 
they typically provide built-in support for debugging. You can set the build type to 
Debug in the IDE settings and use the IDE's debugging tools to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and control execution flow.

### Additional Tips

- **Verbose Output**: You can enable verbose output during the build process to see more details:
  ```bash
  cmake --build . -- VERBOSE=1
  ```

- **Custom Compiler Flags**: If you need specific compiler flags for debugging, you can add them in your `CMakeLists.txt`:
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -g")
  ```

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively debug your CMake-based project.
