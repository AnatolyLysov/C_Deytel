gdb all threads bt to file
Perform the following steps to collect a backtrace from a core dump for all threads.

Find the core file and the executable that created.

Start gdb in the directory where the log file should be created:

By default, gdb will create a logfile called gdb.txt in the current working directory when logging is enabled.  Optionally, specify a different logfile name with this command:

Enable logging by running the following commands:

(gdb) set height 0
(gdb) set logging file /tmp/thread_apply_all_bt.txt
(gdb) set logging on
Copying output to /tmp/thread_apply_all_bt.txt


Request a backtrace:

(gdb) thread apply all bt full


Exit gdb by running the quit command, or press Ctrl-D.
Collect the logfile.
