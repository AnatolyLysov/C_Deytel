Creating a persistent file access system in C involves writing data to a file and reading it back later. Below is an example of a simple program that demonstrates how to create, write to, and read from a file in C. This program will create a file, write some data to it, and then read the data back.

### Example Code: Persistent File Access in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void writeToFile(const char *filename) {
    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "w"); // Open the file for writing
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file for writing");
        return;
    }

    fprintf(file, "Hello, this is a persistent file access example.\n");
    fprintf(file, "You can store data here.\n");
    fclose(file); // Close the file
}

void readFromFile(const char *filename) {
    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "r"); // Open the file for reading
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file for reading");
        return;
    }

    char buffer[256];
    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", buffer); // Print each line read from the file
    }
    fclose(file); // Close the file
}

int main() {
    const char *filename = "example.txt";

    writeToFile(filename); // Write data to the file
    printf("Data written to %s.\n", filename);

    printf("Reading data from %s:\n", filename);
    readFromFile(filename); // Read data from the file

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Include Headers**: The program includes `<stdio.h>` for file operations and `<stdlib.h>` for general utilities.

2. **writeToFile Function**: This function opens a file in write mode (`"w"`), writes some sample text to it, and then closes the file.

3. **readFromFile Function**: This function opens the same file in read mode (`"r"`), reads its content line by line, and prints it to the console.

4. **main Function**: The `main` function defines the filename, calls the `writeToFile` function to create and write to the file, and then calls the `readFromFile` function to read and display the content.

### How to Compile and Run the Program:

1. **Save the Code**: Save the code to a file named `persistent_file_access.c`.

2. **Compile the Code**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved. Use the following command to compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc -o persistent_file_access persistent_file_access.c
   ```

3. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./persistent_file_access
   ```

### Output:
You should see output similar to the following:

```
Data written to example.txt.
Reading data from example.txt:
Hello, this is a persistent file access example.
You can store data here.
```

This example demonstrates basic file operations in C, allowing you to persist data between program executions. 
You can modify the content written to the file or extend the functionality as needed.
