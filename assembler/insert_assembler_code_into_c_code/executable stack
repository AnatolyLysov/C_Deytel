The warning `myasm.o: missing .note.GNU-stack section implies executable stack` indicates that the object file `myasm.o` does not contain a `.note.GNU-stack` section, which is used by the linker to indicate whether the stack is executable or not. This warning is particularly relevant when compiling assembly code or when using inline assembly in C/C++ programs.

### Explanation

- **Executable Stack**: By default, some systems may allow the stack to be executable, which can pose a security risk (e.g., making it vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as stack-based buffer overflows).
- **.note.GNU-stack Section**: This section is a marker that tells the linker whether the stack should be executable (`.note.GNU-stack` section present) or non-executable (section absent). If the section is missing, the linker assumes the stack is executable, hence the warning.

### How to Fix the Warning

1. **Add the .note.GNU-stack Section**: If you want to explicitly mark the stack as non-executable, you can add the `.note.GNU-stack` section to your assembly code. You can do this by adding the following directive at the end of your assembly file:

   ```assembly
   .section .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
   ```

   This tells the linker that the stack should not be executable.

2. **Compile with `-z execstack` Option**: If you want to allow an executable stack (not recommended for security reasons), you can compile your code with the `-z execstack` option. However, this is generally not advisable unless you have a specific reason to do so.

3. **Use `-fno-stack-protector`**: If you are using GCC and the warning persists, you might also consider using the `-fno-stack-protector` flag when compiling your code, although this is also related to disabling stack protection and might not be directly related to the warning.

### Example Assembly Code

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can modify your assembly code to include the `.note.GNU-stack` section:

```assembly
.global add_numbers
add_numbers:
    movl 4(%esp), %eax  ; Get the first argument
    addl 8(%esp), %eax  ; Add the second argument
    ret                  ; Return with the result in EAX

.section .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits  ; Mark stack as non-executable
```

### Conclusion

By adding the `.note.GNU-stack` section, you can resolve the warning about the missing section and indicate that the stack should not be executable. This is a good practice for improving the security of your application.
