Writing and debugging x86/x64 assembly code in Ubuntu using GDB (GNU Debugger) and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) involves several steps. Below, I’ll guide you through the process, including setting up your environment, writing assembly code, compiling it, and debugging with GDB.

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

#### Install Required Tools
Make sure you have the required tools installed on your Ubuntu system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential gdb nasm
```

- **`build-essential`**: Installs essential packages for building software, including GCC.
- **`gdb`**: The GNU Debugger.
- **`nasm`**: The Netwide Assembler, a popular assembler for x86 architecture.

#### Install Visual Studio Code
If you haven't already installed Visual Studio Code, you can do so from the official website or via the terminal:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic code
```

### 2. Writing Assembly Code

Create a new directory for your project and open it in VS Code:

```bash
mkdir my_asm_project
cd my_asm_project
code .
```

Create a new file, for example, `main.asm`, and write your assembly code. Here’s a simple example of an x86_64 assembly program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```asm
section .data
    hello db 'Hello, World!', 0

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Write the string to stdout
    mov rax, 1          ; syscall: sys_write
    mov rdi, 1          ; file descriptor: stdout
    mov rsi, hello      ; pointer to the string
    mov rdx, 13         ; length of the string
    syscall             ; invoke operating system to do the write

    ; Exit the program
    mov rax, 60         ; syscall: sys_exit
    xor rdi, rdi        ; exit code 0
    syscall             ; invoke operating system to exit
```

### 3. Compiling the Assembly Code

You need to assemble and link your code. You can do this using `nasm` and `ld` (the GNU linker). Run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
nasm -f elf64 -o main.o main.asm    # Assemble the code
ld -o main main.o                   # Link the object file to create an executable
```

### 4. Debugging with GDB

To debug your program with GDB, you can start it with your executable:

```bash
gdb ./main
```

#### Basic GDB Commands

Once inside GDB, you can use the following commands:

- **Run the program**: `run`
- **Set a breakpoint**: `break _start` (or at any line number)
- **Step through the code**: `step` (or `s`) to step into functions, `next` (or `n`) to go to the next line
- **Inspect registers**: `info registers`
- **Inspect memory**: `x/20x $rsp` (for example, to examine memory at the stack pointer)
- **Continue execution**: `continue` (or `c`)
- **Quit GDB**: `quit`

### 5. Example Debugging Session

Here’s a brief example of how a debugging session might look:

1. Start GDB with your program:

   ```bash
   gdb ./main
   ```

2. Set a breakpoint at the `_start` label:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) break _start
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) run
   ```

4. Step through the code:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) step
   ```

5. Inspect registers or memory if needed:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) info registers
   (gdb) x/20x $rsp
   ```

6. Continue execution until the program exits:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) continue
   ```

7. Quit GDB:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) quit
   ```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively write and debug x86/x64 assembly code using GDB and Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu. Be sure to explore GDB's extensive documentation for more advanced debugging techniques and commands. Happy coding!
