The error message you're encountering indicates that there is a mismatch between the architecture of the object file (`p27.o`) and the architecture expected by the linker (which is targeting x86-64). This typically happens when you're trying to assemble and link code for different architectures.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that both the assembler and the linker are targeting the same architecture. If your intention is to create a 32-bit application, you can specify the architecture explicitly when using `nasm` and `ld`.

### Solution:

1. **Assemble with NASM for 32-bit:**
   Use the `-f elf32` option to assemble your code for 32-bit architecture.

   ```bash
   nasm -f elf32 -g p27.asm
   ```

2. **Link with LD for 32-bit:**
   Use the `-m elf_i386` option with `ld` to specify that you are linking a 32-bit object file.

   ```bash
   ld -m elf_i386 p27.o -o p27
   ```

### Complete Commands:

Here are the complete commands you should run:

```bash
nasm -f elf32 -g p27.asm
ld -m elf_i386 p27.o -o p27
```

### Additional Notes:

- Make sure that your assembly code (`p27.asm`) is compatible with 32-bit architecture.
- If you need to create a 64-bit application instead, you should adjust the commands to use `-f elf64` for NASM and link normally without specifying `-m elf_i386`.

If you follow these steps, it should resolve the architecture mismatch error you are experiencing.
